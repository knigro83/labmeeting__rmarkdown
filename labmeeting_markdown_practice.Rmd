## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

: This is an awesome table


Using datatable and leaflet to make nice tables and maps

```{r}
#packages we need
library(DT)
library(leaflet)

#make example table of some locations
locations<- data.frame(city=c("Fort Collins","Denver","Colorado Springs"), lat=c(40.590475,39.732326,38.840060), lon = c(-105.077276,-104.981500, -104.774885))
#make a nice looking table
datatable(locations)

#make a cool looking interactive map
leaflet(locations) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = ~lon, lat = ~lat, popup = ~city)
#click on location markers to see the name of the city pop up!
```
